A small mod for my modpack, A Pile Of Gears 2 (the previous, A Pile of Gears 1, was set up for a small server and never distributed publically). This will add tree-taps which can be used to get maple sap (to boil into maple syrup) and latex. Latex will have a recipe to combine, low-heated, with sulfur dust - any tagged sulfur dust item - to create rubber. Rubber can then be used to make Create belts efficiently.

I might set this up so that Create is optional, but that would require some effort on the part of modpack devs. Many items would, by default, have no use or no recipe - or neither a use nor a recipe.

Many thanks to [create-multiloader-addon-template](https://github.com/Fabricators-of-Create/create-multiloader-addon-template), which saved me some time and effort messing around with Gradle - much appreciated, I hate Gradle.
